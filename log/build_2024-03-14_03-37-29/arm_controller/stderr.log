  By not providing "Findgazebo_ros_link_attacher.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "gazebo_ros_link_attacher", but CMake did not find one.

  "gazebo_ros_link_attacher" with any of the following names:

    gazebo_ros_link_attacherConfig.cmake
    gazebo_ros_link_attacher-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "gazebo_ros_link_attacher" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "gazebo_ros_link_attacher_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "gazebo_ros_link_attacher" provides
  a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
